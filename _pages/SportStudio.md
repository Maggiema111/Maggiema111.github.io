    <p> With 14 years of piano experience and six years on the double bass, achieving ABRSM Grade 8 in Performance and Grade 5 in Music Theory, I have developed a profound background in music. My creative expression shines in my work with the Bunbun Band, where I compose and improvise double bass parts for unique pop and rock arrangements, significantly enhancing my musicality and creativity. Currently, I also collaborate with a local orchestra and perform with jazz musicians at a bar, further expanding my versatility as a performer. My approach to creativity focuses on transforming familiar tunes into unexpected interpretations, breathing new life into them.</p>
